\maketitle

Shanghainese (Shanghai Chinese) is a variety of Wu Chinese spoken in Shanghai, one of the four municipalities of China. 
The tonal system in Shanghai are mainly divided into 5 tone system. there is not a consistent transctiption of tones caus they are in different representaing system: letter and number transcription.

The first factor differentiates Shanghainese tones into murmured vs. clear (or plain) syllables, a phonological manifestation of register \citep{yip1980}. Terminology varies across traditions: classical Chinese phonology contrasts yin and yang registers; Yip uses +murmur or +upper; Duanmu employs \textsc{[+slack]}; and Keating refers to it as \textsc{[+spread glottis]}. Functionally, this feature introduces two characteristics into tonal realization: a lowered pitch and a breathy voice quality. Consequently, murmured syllables tend to begin with a low pitch and occur only with voiced onsets. In contrast, clear syllables (T1, T2, T4) start with a relatively high pitch; when the onset is an obstruent, it is obligatorily voiceless. Syllables with sonorant onsets, however, are not affected by this register distinction.

The second dichotomy concerns the post-vocalic state. When a syllable is closed by a glottal stop, it is termed a checked syllable. Checked syllables are characterized by shorter vowel duration, a sharper pitch contour, and a glottal constriction at the coda. In Shanghainese, this condition restricts the distribution of certain tones (e.g., T4 and T5), as shown in the table. By contrast, unchecked (or “slack”) syllables allow for longer vowels and smoother tonal contours.



Previous research offers divergent descriptions of what ``murmur'' entails. There are following proposals and their corresponding representations:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item It is a tonal feature underlyingly shared by larnygeal \citep{yip1993tonal}
    \item It is a property of the \textit{onset} and conditioned by [+voice] (Duanmu 1988)
    \item It is a feature of the \textit{initial consonant} (Ren 1992).  
    \item It is a property of the \textit{phonological word} \citep{zhu1999shanghai}
\end{enumerate}


\citep{yipsniderPhonologyTone1993} proposes three possible candidates where register could either be a laryngeal feature \textsc{[voice, +spread glottis]}, a tonal feature \textsc{[-upper]} or a feature with afgfinities to bothe tonal aand larynegeal nodes. Of these candidates, (I) directly predicts that murmur predicts the onset voicing but impoosible to explain the deletation of murmur in no-iunitial syllables, this can be accounted by (ii) but it doesnt reval the why upper should condition onset voicing. In this case, Yip proposes that the murmur is a feature which partakes both characterialsices. This is argued agaisnt by \citep{zhu1999shanghai} who points out that in the realization, the syllable-initialed voiced obstruent is sometimes voiceless, (see also in \citep{chen2015shanghai}).


Duanmu, based on Bao's model, proposes that the Register is always reflected by voice quality but not always by pitch. The model then he proposes is that pitch and refgister are two planes, while the first one dominiates stiff and slack voice quality, the second one contails tones. A similar practice was done by Ren (1992) who treats the mmurmur feature as the feature of the initial consonant.

Another issue concerning the shanghai feature geometry. In addition to where the register should go, there are also debates about the place of medial and coda should be. Duanmu proposes that all Chinese dialects to have the same underlying structure. Instead of using mora theory, he uses X slots to indicate three slots under syllable: one for onset and two for rime. which zhu differs.
